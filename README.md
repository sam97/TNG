A copy of the files needed to draw the-number-graph.

### What is a Number Graph?
Some term I came up with to support an idea I had. Take any thread from /r/counting. Considering that each thread is linear with no branches (shorter branches are ignored), the idea ~~is~~ was to write a script that will go through the thread, and for each number/comment, store its data persistently. Using this data, we can plot graphs and come up with some sweet statistics (among other things)!

**Update**: So the thread that was the motivation behind this little piece of code got nuked by the mods, so there is no reason for me to continue (or even a thread to test on). So as of now, this project is ***abandoned***. I'll keep it up because I know there are communities that *may* find it useful (also because I really don't want to delete this one :( ). So if you want to continue this, feel free to fork it. I may even contribute if you let me know about what you're doing!
